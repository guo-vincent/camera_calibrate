# Self Check List

1. Rigidly mount both cameras
2. Disable Autofocus, Autoexposure, Auto white balance
    also fix resolution and FPS (probably 1280x720, 30FPS)
3. print calibration chessboard at <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/doc/pattern.png>
    100% scale, 25mm per square, on flat, rigid surface
4. install requirements.txt
5. run util/check_camera_ids.py to know what ids should go for --left and --right in capture_stereo.py
6. Capture some number of stereo image pairs (around 10~20) and run scripts/capture_stereo.py
    - Vary distances, Tilt, Position in Frame, etc...
    - For each image, run scripts\test.py to see if board is even being detected.
7. Calibrate each camera using scripts/calibrate_intrinsics.py and get yaml files back
8. Get relative pose between 2 cameras with scripts\calibrate_stereo.py and generate stereo_extrinsics.yaml
9. Use scripts\rectify_images.py to make epipolar lines horizontal.
    Left and right images should align vertically, guide lines horizontally
Calibration done after this.

10. test with runtime\stereo_depth.py
